## FAQ

__What does this plugin do?__

Very simple, it is using an internal function of Matomo core to edit the config file through the Matomo User Interface. So to say, you can perform exactly the same thing by editing the config file directly.

__Why should I use this feature? __

When creating a segment within Matomo Analytics, it takes a lot of time for the server to perform the calculations. As a result if your Matomo instance has many users, technically it can slow down a lot the User Interface of Matomo. The idea of this plugin is to allow only some users in particular to have the right to create segments.

__Can users still access to the segment feature?__

Of course, this plugin just remove the possibility to create segments. That's it.
