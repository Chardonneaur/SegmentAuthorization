# Matomo SegmentAuthorization Plugin

## Description

By default, anyone with write access can create segments within Matomo Analytics. It can be an issue if you have many users as a segment creation will require a lot of calculation from the server side. This plugin allows you to define who has the authorization to create segments within Matomo Analytics. Only the super user can access to this User Interface feature in order to define who can create segments. If the feature is set on admin, users with a write access only won't see the button to create segments, though they will still be able to apply segments.
